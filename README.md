# MRI Guided Prostate Biopsy Image Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing images related to MRI-guided prostate biopsies. It utilizes Python and popular libraries like IPython for interactive computing and image processing.

## Project Goals

- To provide a platform for exploring and manipulating medical images, specifically those from MRI-guided prostate biopsies.
- To develop and implement image analysis techniques for extracting meaningful information from these images.
- To facilitate research and development in the field of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## Key Features

- Interactive image visualization and exploration using IPython.
- Image processing and analysis capabilities.
- Potential for integration with machine learning models for automated diagnosis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your Google Colab environment.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install IPython`.
3. Run the notebook to view the code and execute the image analysis steps.

## Usage

This project can be used by researchers, clinicians, and data scientists interested in:

- Visualizing and exploring MRI images of the prostate.
- Developing and testing image analysis algorithms for prostate cancer detection.
- Building machine learning models for automated prostate cancer diagnosis.
